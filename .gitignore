**/.DS_Store

# Never check in caches. This file name is set in book_start.R

cache-directory

# This is where RStudio gathers part of the book. Files are transfered to
# output_dir once the build is complete.

_bookdown_files


# Because _bookdown.yml has book_filename: "book_temp", there is a lot of
# garbage with this prefix, both individual files and directories. None of
# it should be saved.

book_temp*

# Local junk directory where stuff gets built, but it is not checked in.

junk/*

# Only the book-builder needs to deal with this file. It gets replaced
# everytime you knit a chapter, so it should just be ignored. May need to remove this to fix references page.

packages.bib

# No matter what happens above, everything in docs/ must be checked in

!docs/*

# Don't need to check below directory's into version control. (Updated for quarto)

# Trying to put this directory in my gitignore so that my staging area isn't flooded every time I preview the website
