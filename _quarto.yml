# To build book locally...

# Make sure quarto is installed (this should already have been done automatically)
# Run the "quarto preview" command in terminal
# (optionally a file name such as index.qmd to render a specific file)

# This will render the entire website locally which could take a while if it is the first time rendering.
# If shown error about not having quarto installed run this command in Command Prompt (navigate to the primer folder with cd)

# If there are no errors in the files then this should locally preview the entire primer
# Take a look around to make sure that you're changes are working (even if there are no errors)

# Need to check if we can set junk to output-dir instead of docs like for bookdown

# Below is the code for the quarto.yml (mostly taken by referencing example books)
# Good example book: https://github.com/jjallaire/hopr
# Specifically referenced the "_quarto.yml" file

# Note to self: Always ADD MORE COMMENTS!

project:
  type: book
  output-dir: docs

# Tryed to use pre-render for quarto instead of before_chapter script which was previously used in bookdown
# Gave up on finding quarto eqivalent of before_chapter_script and after
# pre/post-render work differently from bookdown before_chapter_script (not working)
# For more info see: https://community.rstudio.com/t/cannot-get-quarto-pre-render-to-work/143566
# Or my RS Community query: https://community.rstudio.com/t/quarto-book-start-equivalent/144196
# For now I added a "hidden libraries" code chunk at the beginning of most chapters to replace book_start (hopefully temporarily)


# Most items below taken from old bookdown primer's index.rmd yml header (needs to be here for quarto)
# All general info under the book header

# Still working on references in bibliography/references page
# Tryed adding code (for bib) from book_end to end of each file--not all references loaded

# Trying to add option to download as a pdf/epub doc but not sure if this is working
